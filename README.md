# Decision Trees

## Introduction





Decision Trees are versatile machine learning algorithms capable of handling both classification and regression tasks. They are particularly powerful, as they can fit complex datasets while maintaining interpretability.

Additionally, Decision Trees form the building blocks of ensemble methods such as Random Forests and gradient-boosting algorithms like XGBoost, which rank among the most effective machine learning techniques available today.

At their core, tree-based methods partition the feature space into a series of rectangular regions, within which a simple model, often a constant value, is fitted. These methods, while conceptually straightforward, are highly effective. A common implementation is CART (Classification and Regression Trees), which simplifies the terminology and unifies the approach for both classification and regression problems.

Letâ€™s illustrate the concept using a regression problem with a continuous response variable $Y$ and two input variables, $X_1$ and $X_2$, each constrained to the unit interval. To simplify, we focus on recursive binary partitioning:

1. First, the feature space is split into two regions. Within each region, the response is modeled by the mean of $Y$. The split variable and the split-point are chosen to maximize the fit.
2. Subsequently, one or both regions are further split, and this process continues until a predefined stopping criterion is met.

The resulting regression model predicts $Y$ as a constant $c_m$ within each region $R_m$, expressed mathematically as:

<div style="text-align: center;">
$$\hat{f}(X) = \sum_{m=1}^{M} c_m \cdot I\{(X_1, X_2) \in R_m\}$$.
</div>

where $I$ is an indicator function that equals 1 if the condition is true and 0 otherwise.

One of the key advantages of recursive binary trees lies in their interpretability, making them a popular choice for exploratory data analysis and real-world applications.
